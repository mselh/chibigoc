This is a port of the Rui Ueyama's chibicc compiler in Go. 
(github.com/rui314/chibicc)

I don't think, any of the work done, or will be done, 
would differentiate itself significantly from the chibicc.

my motivation is to get an understanding of a c compiler.

chibicc compiler's commit history is set to be informative,
and they are incremental. 

this project aims to follow the informative commit history of chibicc.
